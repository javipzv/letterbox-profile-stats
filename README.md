# letterbox-profile-stats
A web scraping application that retrieves the most viewed directors and actors of a Letterboxd user based on their watched movies.

This application uses data from Letterboxd. Letterboxd is a site that allows users to share their taste in films.
Members can write reviews or share their opinions about films, keep track of what they have seen in the past, record viewing dates, make lists of films and showcase their favorite films, 
as well as meet and interact with other cinephiles. Films can be rated, reviewed, added to a specific date's diary entry, included in a list, and tagged with relevant keywords.
