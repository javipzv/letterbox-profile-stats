# Letterbox Stats
A web scraping application that retrieves the most viewed directors and actors of a Letterboxd user based on their watched movies.

This application uses data from Letterboxd. Letterboxd is a site that allows users to share their taste in films.
Members can write reviews or share their opinions about films, keep track of what they have seen in the past, record viewing dates, make lists of films and showcase their favorite films, 
as well as meet and interact with other cinephiles. Films can be rated, reviewed, added to a specific date's diary entry, included in a list, and tagged with relevant keywords.

Enhance your Letterboxd experience with my web scraping application that provides unique insights into your movie-watching habits. 
Discover your most watched film directors and actors based on the movies you've viewed. Explore personalized statistics that go beyond what Letterboxd offers, adding an intriguing dimension to your film journey.
You can also compare the ratings of the movies you and other Letterboxd user have seen, allowing you to see which type of movies you like more than other person and viceverse.
