# Letterbox Stats
A web scraping application that retrieves the most viewed directors and actors of a Letterboxd user based on their watched movies.

This application uses data from Letterboxd. Letterboxd is a site that allows users to share their taste in films.
Films can be rated, reviewed, etc... Discover your most watched film directors and actors based on the movies you've viewed.
You can also compare the ratings of the movies you and other Letterboxd user have seen, allowing you to see which type of movies you like more than other person and viceverse.

Please note that I am already learning how to use these technologies (HTML, CSS, Flask...) and there are a lot of things that can be improved.

## How to try it
I have created a Google Colab to try it: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WP4RFnmLC8zPZ9EWEex43l2_vHLPZJ3u. Recommended Google Chrome.
